# Dinner Picker

Dinner Picker is a web-based application that utilizes recursion to traverse a
binary tree. User inputs will determine the direction the application takes to get
to the next node of the tree, till a leaf is reached. Once a leaf is reached, a
response is returned, which is the food type the user should have for dinner.
